Abigail Kimball,2023-02-18,4.0,0.0,"Very much enjoy Point Brugge Cafe. Employees and atmosphere are great. For the quality and atmosphere I would expect more gluten free options, though. I can usually finagle something with the server and chef from a dish on the menu, but they always have such lovely glutenous possibilities it would be wonderful if they could make gf versions of those available. Hence 4 stars. I'd definitely go more often and recommend it to other friends with Celiac disease.",female,Winter

Food was pretty delicious!
Only issue is, it is definitely set up café size but running like a full restaurant. It has a charm, but it can become pretty crowded and noisy (for dinner! Not sure about lunch or brunch!).

I would definitely try lunch, brunch, and more dinner items.

Christopher Schmidt,2022-09-08,3.0,0.0,"I wish I could give 3.5 stars. Google's rating system has flaws. I have adored this place for quite some time, and last time I was in, it seems like standards have slipped a bit. When the place famous for moules frite has no Belgian beer on draft, it's disappointing. The menu seems shorter by about 25%. A beloved bartender seems to have moved on, and the staff seems really young. As in green. Our server was a delight, but there were gaps in service. We were in at 7:30 on a Friday. I accept that it might take me a moment to get a pint at that moment, but it should not take 20 minutes. Mussels were great, but I suspect that was not 1.5 lbs as listed on the menu. The pandemic has been hard on restaurants, to be sure. This place is still head and shoulders above so many other places, but it feels like the love is gone. This place used to be a Palace, and it feels like they have slipped. I truly hope they get things back in order.",male,Fall

Other workers ended up doing things that she was supposed to do, like asking if they could take my plate or if I wanted coffee. I overheard my waitress getting upset with another worker for ""forcing her to split tips."" Rude. I don't get why/how she ignored me so much and so often when she was working the bar and I was right in front of her. Clearly the other workers noticed or they wouldn't have offered me things or asked. On top of that, the food was just ok. For the price of $26, I expected at least decent eggs Benedict. Don't call them eggs Benedict if they don't have ham. The sauce was ok but not much flavor. The eggs WERE cooked perfectly BUT over crab cakes (that were just ok) and over tomatoes. The acidity of the tomatoes ruined the egg and the whole dish fell off. I also hated that they served fruit right on the same plate as the eggs, where the sauce and egg yolk spilled over. Gross. Overall, this place had merely ok service and food. Not worth the hype or the price. I will try one more time and see if other dishes and other waitresses are decent, though, because I really had my hopes up for this place in the community.",female,Winter

K H,2021-11-20,1.0,1.0,"Food (is sometimes) excellent...usually the best mussels in town and good beer selection....but today's curry mussels were lacking flavor and the sauce tasted watered down.  The service has also been going down hill.  I Stood by the door for 5 minutes and no one acknowledged that I was there.  So I walked to the server stand and said I was here to pick up an order.  Was told another 15-20 minute wait...so 30-minutes later than what we were told when we ordered.  Will stay away from here for a while.  (Also FWIW, workers do not wear masks...I understand it's not required by law, but it's common courtesy while the world is still trying to recover from a pandemic)...also adding that veggie burgers were all missing cheese...but not worth the trip back to the restaurant to mention another disappointment",unknown,Fall
Barbara Stack,2021-11-14,5.0,0.0,"This small, comfy neighborhood restaurant offers an interesting menu. The flatbread I ordered was particularly delicious.

Pei Wang,2021-11-08,1.0,1.0,"My husband, my 6-year old daughter, and I were looking forward to dining at this place after a long Sunday hike. We sat at the table at 4:30 PM, ordered and got our water at 4:40 PM, waited until 5:40 PM with no food, no explanation, and not even single check-in from the waiter. At first, I thought they were just busy, and then I noticed that the two tables who came after us all got their food. After a few back-and-forths with the waiter, we finally got our food. We ordered the Moules Frites, the Braised Short Rib Flatbread, the Point Burger, and the Carbonnade Flamande. My poor 6-year old was starving by then and devoured the Baguette that came with the Moules Frites. Then came the entrees. The flatbread tasted like it was left on the counter overnight. The Brioche bun was over-toasted and became hard and crumbled. The burger patty was cold and dry. The Carbonnade Flamande was...well, at least it had a large portion. The tastiest food tonight was the Moules Frites, but unfortunately, a few mussels were a bit sandy. The waiter was sensible enough to take the flatbread off of our check. I wish I could reverse time and go elsewhere.
(Sorry for being so critical during this particular time because I know many restaurants are short on staff and ingredients. I genuinely hope restaurants like Point Brugge Cafe, much loved by the community, can be where people find enjoyment and normality, not chaos and neglect.)",unknown,Fall

Suzie Sunshine,2021-09-04,5.0,2.0,"Just tried this place for the first time and it’s lovely! Food is well priced with good portions for your $. Our server Evana was great! She was personable, chill, friendly. I will ask for her again! We had dinner but I heard they also have a brunch so we will be back!! The indoor to outdoor seating style is nice, you go up levels so you can always have a view of outside.

They have pretty good mixed drinks (my fav. Was “The Silverman” which was a twist on a margarita) and a great selection of beers and wine. The menu is clearly Belgian with a lot of dishes with lemon and some very popular mussels (basically everyone but us ordered them). I tried the Chaud Chèvre salad and it was a generous portion with really fresh, healthy greens. You can tell the food is a point of pride because everything looked great, smelled great, and so on. My partner ordered a more traditional beef dish and he LOVED it. Kid friendly too, it’s casual and family oriented.

Overall this place is quaint, on a relatively quiet street next to some other very good restaurants. Street parking was free and easy. I highly recommend! Especially if you like mussels!

It was reminiscent of the feeling of ordering soup as a child in a diner - heartwarming and wholesome. The service was  wonderful and an absolutely sweet server who gave us a lot of bread when we asked for more.

We've tried almost every good restaurant there is in Pittsburgh and by far this is the best for value, quality of food and service. It's not a trendy gimmicky restaurant. It's just a very good place to go and get a great meal. Parking is not as difficult as other places we've visited in the Pittsburgh area. We arrived without reservations and was seated within minutes. The service was outstanding. This is going to be our go to restaurant whenever we are in town. I think other restaurant owners should visit this place and learn how to do it right. Great job.

Edwin Yu,2019-06-08,2.0,2.0,"Maybe they got so many good ratings that this place’s head got too big. The last time I was here, everything was excellent. We arrived at six and had to wait about 30 minutes. It’s not a bad wait time had the experience, food, and drinks were good. It because quickly clear to me that the problem is inefficient usage of staff. From tables being cleared, to ordering drinks, getting the drinks, ordering food and getting our food... was slow beyond reason. They should either have more wait staff or do the team-waiter method to speed things up to a reasonable pace. Oh, it also took the waiter forever to get our check. Then there’s the food. The mussels were not the freshest. My friend actually encountered two of them that is too far gone. My lamb fettuccine was just not good. The lamb was too dry and stringy and the pasta was over cooked to a point that it fell apart the moment you try to pick it up. Then the waiter didn’t listen and got me a virgin version of the lemonade. I may tide this place one more chance in the future. But today has definitely been a disappointment.

I have searched for another place who can make this dish but there is nowhere else that does it like P. Brugge. The building is small but the flavor is huge and price point to me is affordable. The service is always friendly and inviting ... I can't wait to go back.

mai m,2018-05-27,4.0,0.0,"(Translated by Google) Located in a quiet residential area, this restaurant has terrace seats and a bar space. Luckily when I went, I was seated right away before it got too crowded. However, it is a popular restaurant with quite a few people waiting for about an hour. You can eat a wide variety of alcohol and delicious Belgian-Mediterranean cuisine. I didn't try it this time, but the mussels seem to be the restaurant's top recommendation. You can't make a reservation, but it's a great place to visit with friends. The price range is also reasonable and it is one of the restaurants I would like to visit again. I would love to try the brunch next time.

閑静な住宅街にあるこのレストランはテラス席、バースペースと２席がありますが、座席数はさほど多くなく、予約も受け付けていないので待っている人で長蛇の列となることもあるようです。私が行った際には幸いにも混雑する前でありすぐに座席に案内されました。しかし、１時間ほどするとかなりの人が待っているくらい人気のレストランです。種類豊富なアルコールと美味しいベルギー・地中海料理が食べられます。今回私はトライしていませんがムール貝がこのレストランの一番のお勧めのようです。予約はできませんが友人と訪れるにも最高の場所です。価格帯も手ごろですし、私はまた行きたいレストランの一つです。次回はブランチもぜひ行ってみたいと思っています。",unknown,Spring

Desserts are generally tasty, although some are not that special. In the colder months they've had a pumpkin roll that is perfectly decadent.

It's a pretty small place and can get really busy for dinner, but there's a bar where you can get drinks, and you can also call in orders to go. Lunch is less busy. During the warmer months they open outdoor seating.

I've only been disappointed twice here, once by a fish special (it just didn't taste like much) and by the brunch (small portions and underwhelming flavor, including a very sad waffle). Sticking to the lunch or dinner menu has never let me down.

I wish the restaurant accepted reservations, but because it is so busy and small, I understand why they do not. This also causes the interior to become overpacked and busy, but seating is better in the summer when you can both wait and dine outside.

I went all of two times, and I can't say I had a bad experience either time, but I also can't say it was exceptional. Sure, the beer is good, but the Sharp Edge has a more extensive collection of Belgian beers. The food is good - mussels, of course - but I had more memorable mussels at Casbah. The mussel broth is luscious, and they are served with the classic pomme frites with mayonnaise (don't knock it 'til you rock it, and you must rock it). However, the mussels I had were a bit overcooked, which may have just been bad luck. Do not attempt to order both the mussels and an entree with the hopes of finishing them unless you're that guy from Man vs. Food. The mac and cheese was a bit dry and...flavorless. But it's still a nice place to have dinner if you have good company and some time to wait for a table since the place is quite cramped, which ups the coziness factor.",female,Fall
