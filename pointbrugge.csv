Abigail Kimball,2/18/2023,4,0,"Very much enjoy Point Brugge Cafe. Employees and atmosphere are great. For the quality and atmosphere I would expect more gluten free options, though. I can usually finagle something with the server and chef from a dish on the menu, but they always have such lovely glutenous possibilities it would be wonderful if they could make gf versions of those available. Hence 4 stars. I'd definitely go more often and recommend it to other friends with Celiac disease."
Joe Lizik,2/17/2023,5,0,"This is one of our favorite little places that is just off the beaten path. Have to get the mussels. Great date night idea. Intimate and cozy, but only street parking so might have a little issue finding a spot depending on the day."

"Laura McAuley, Realtor",1/20/2023,5,0,"Our favorite place in the whole of Pittsburgh. Yummy everything every time! Mussels with one Frits served with good mayo. Great cocktails too. Neighborhood cafe at its best. Alas, they don’t take reservations but soooo worth the wait!"
sue barbeau,1/15/2023,5,0,"Love the food before, today we ordered dinner take out.  Steak Frites, Sage & butter Gnocchi were wonderful. But the Carbonnade Flamande was too salty, maybe cooked too long. The beef was no longer tender and so salty that it was bitter. Very disappointed.

Kolby Howell,10/15/2022,4,1,"Amazing staff with amazing service! The food came out quick. We had a small table, but with teamwork from the staff and my group, we made it work. :)
Food was pretty delicious!
Only issue is, it is definitely set up café size but running like a full restaurant. It has a charm, but it can become pretty crowded and noisy (for dinner! Not sure about lunch or brunch!).

I would definitely try lunch, brunch, and more dinner items.

Chris Pavone,9/10/2022,1,1,"This is usually a consistent place but not this past Friday. Service was inattentive despite the restaurant not being busy. That being said , however, it was the food that was the most disappointing. Luke warm to cool mussels, a well over cooked burger including even the bun being on the charred side,  a salmon salad missing the salmon until well into the meal, even the frites were below par. Not at all what was expected from what has been a usually reliable spot."
Christopher Schmidt,9/8/2022,3,0,"I wish I could give 3.5 stars. Google's rating system has flaws. I have adored this place for quite some time, and last time I was in, it seems like standards have slipped a bit. When the place famous for moules frite has no Belgian beer on draft, it's disappointing. The menu seems shorter by about 25%. A beloved bartender seems to have moved on, and the staff seems really young. As in green. Our server was a delight, but there were gaps in service. We were in at 7:30 on a Friday. I accept that it might take me a moment to get a pint at that moment, but it should not take 20 minutes. Mussels were great, but I suspect that was not 1.5 lbs as listed on the menu. The pandemic has been hard on restaurants, to be sure. This place is still head and shoulders above so many other places, but it feels like the love is gone. This place used to be a Palace, and it feels like they have slipped. I truly hope they get things back in order."

We also shared a plate of frites.  Was going to try the mussels like I normally do and would recommend those as well.  Place is always packed so reservations are a good idea.  Patio was open and still packed when we arrived at 8pm

Em Ruffles,7/8/2022,5,0,"Three friends out for a fun-day decided to stop here for lunch. We had all been here before but not for some time. Two got the daily special, which was a lobster roll. I got the croque-monsour sandwich. We were very happy with the food and the staff. There were so many tasty choices, it was difficult to select one's meal."

Even a customer/client came in with rude remarks as she pushed passed a woman patiently waiting in line behind me. No desire to return and hopefully it was just an ""off"" day."
Adam Fossi,6/23/2022,5,0,"We used to dinner here every weekend when they first opened.  It's honestly been 10+ years since we were last there, and you know what?

Emily Sanders,5/26/2022,3,1,This was my first visit after many recommendations. Service was confused and slow for a late lunch. Mistakes and our simple order taking a very long time. Food was ok. Maybe it was just a fluke and we came on an off day. We will try it again before making more judgement.

CA Price,5/19/2022,3,1,"We waited 45 minutes for a table and when we were seated they told us they were out of mussels! That's the sole reason we went there. Its a signature dish of theirs. We would have left had we known sooner.
I settled for the chicken and waffles and my husband got the poutine. Chicken was good but the waffle was overcooked and dry. His poutine was flavorful.
Service was slow...
We will return and definitely ask if they have mussels BEFORE any wait."
Chris Rodocker,5/18/2022,5,0,"My only gripe is that we've been missing out on this place for so long.  Great, intimate little eatery tucked away in the Point Breeze neighborhood.  The mussels and fries are fantastic as is the braised beef. Looking forward to future visits to try more of the menu."

Deian Tabakov,4/22/2022,4,1,It gets busy during lunch time. Call ahead if you're going with six or more people. I was not very impressed with the fried avocado sandwich. My table mates ordered the mussels and said that they were pretty good. Strong anti-recommendation against the charcuterie - it was just a few cuts for a really high cost.
Dana Mack,4/19/2022,5,0,
Jeff Jones,4/16/2022,5,0,"Intimate European-style cafe, Belgian cuisine (sans waffles). Chaud-someting salad was very fresh and tasty.  Portobellos were a good protein option for me.  Jackie had the avocado burger - she loved it!  Dish prices were moderately high, but worth it.  Alcohol prices were very steep.  We sat at the bar and received wonderful assistance from Sarah."

Mateo Llanos,4/7/2022,5,1,"We dropped in on a cold, snowy day and were not disappointed.  The food was both delicious and a good value.  No reservations, but there was no wait for a table.  The Belgian Beer selection was excellent too.  Our server seemed nice enough, but we could tell she was slightly more attentive to other tables who were regulars to the restaurant.  No problem though, it didn't detract from the great experience.  We will definitely be back."

Robert Hillman,3/6/2022,5,2,"We had a wonderful brunch here. There are some terrific brunchy items, like the salmon flatbread I ordered, and typically breakfast items available, like chicken and waffles. Everything we ordered had great flavor, though we all agreed it was under salted / not salted at all. Go for the roasted potatoes. The au gratin was nice but the roasted potatoes were much better. The bloody mary was spot on as well. Also we all enjoyed the coffee.

That being said, when I'm paying what I am, I don't want a noisey kid next to me.  Beer selection is exquisite, hope you like Belgians too. Provided the high prices don't bother you and you're not seated next to a child, it's not a bad spot

Cat B,2/24/2022,4,0,"Went for brunch. The food and drinks were good but fairly standard. I think anyone could find something they enjoy on the menu, and it was reasonably owned. Staff was really nice even though they were absolutely swamped. I don't see myself going back for brunch again, but I'll probably go back for dinner sometime."
Chris Boehm,2/15/2022,5,0,
Astrid G,2/10/2022,2,1,"Kind of an ok experience. Ate at the bar. Waitress was not super attentive. Other workers ended up doing things that she was supposed to do, like asking if they could take my plate or if I wanted coffee. I overheard my waitress getting upset with another worker for ""forcing her to split tips."" Rude. I don't get why/how she ignored me so much and so often when she was working the bar and I was right in front of her. Clearly the other workers noticed or they wouldn't have offered me things or asked. On top of that, the food was just ok. For the price of $26, I expected at least decent eggs Benedict. Don't call them eggs Benedict if they don't have ham. The sauce was ok but not much flavor. The eggs WERE cooked perfectly BUT over crab cakes (that were just ok) and over tomatoes. The acidity of the tomatoes ruined the egg and the whole dish fell off. I also hated that they served fruit right on the same plate as the eggs, where the sauce and egg yolk spilled over. Gross. Overall, this place had merely ok service and food. Not worth the hype or the price. I will try one more time and see if other dishes and other waitresses are decent, though, because I really had my hopes up for this place in the community."

workingman's view,2/6/2022,5,0,"This is the spot for awesome eats! Point burger is a must have, along with the muscles! I argue that the point burger is the best burger in the city!

Service is great!"
David Troetschel,1/28/2022,5,0,"I tend to stop in for lunch and sit at the bar for fast service, food and drink are fantastic and staff are great. Many people take it easy and socialize with a friend- kind regulars.
I haven't had a single thing I disliked, chef's are on-point."
Arturs Abolins,1/23/2022,1,2,It would be nice if could update your hours on the website like you updated of the front door. That would save unnecessary driving. Speaking on behalf of at least 5 people who were there just after 11am on a Sunday.
Zoe N (narcokitty404),12/23/2021,4,0,
Megan Lloyd,12/22/2021,5,1,"This place has had consistently high standards for food, drinks, and staff for the roughly 5 years I've been going here. They've got a rotating menu with a handful of delicious staples. Their fortes are mussels and Belgian beers. I, however, am not a fan of either of these things and I still love the place. They have a small menu and they do it well. They don't take reservations and it's a smaller establishment. But, for me it's worth the wait. We often pop in for a night cap after going out for dinner, or jump in line a little early for their wonderful brunch. It's also suitable for people with dietary restrictions, but the options might be limited."
Edward Ng,12/20/2021,4,0,The atmosphere is great.  Cute place for a date.  Staff was friendly and knowledgeable.
Jacques Chelly,12/19/2021,3,0,"We ordered to go. Our order included a classic moules and a curry one, we only got  2 classic ones. We ordered extra breads, we didn’t get it. Last but not least, Point Brudge was the place where you could get the best French fries in town. I am sorry to say that it is not the case anymore. The French fries were smoothly. On a positive note, the moules were good and big"

Thomas Parker,11/22/2021,5,0,Very trendy.  I loved the home cooked foods.  I enjoyed Poutine and my girlfriend got the grilled cheese which was out of this world.   The service was excellent and there was only a short wait for our food.
K H,11/20/2021,1,1,"Food (is sometimes) excellent...usually the best mussels in town and good beer selection....but today's curry mussels were lacking flavor and the sauce tasted watered down.  The service has also been going down hill.  I Stood by the door for 5 minutes and no one acknowledged that I was there.  So I walked to the server stand and said I was here to pick up an order.  Was told another 15-20 minute wait...so 30-minutes later than what we were told when we ordered.  Will stay away from here for a while.  (Also FWIW, workers do not wear masks...I understand it's not required by law, but it's common courtesy while the world is still trying to recover from a pandemic)...also adding that veggie burgers were all missing cheese...but not worth the trip back to the restaurant to mention another disappointment"
Barbara Stack,11/14/2021,5,0,"This small, comfy neighborhood restaurant offers an interesting menu. The flatbread I ordered was particularly delicious. We ordered fries for the table because we were told they are the best in Pittsburgh, and we were not disappointed! As a bonus, the noise level was quite low, allowing for easy conversation. And the after-lunch coffee was quite good."
Linda Davis,11/11/2021,3,0,"The frites are outstanding and addictive.  It’s in a lovely neighborhood and the fellow patrons seemed great.  A good neighborhood small bar, too.  I had the falafel sandwich- good but overwhelmed by the bun"
Pei Wang,11/8/2021,1,1,"My husband, my 6-year old daughter, and I were looking forward to dining at this place after a long Sunday hike. We sat at the table at 4:30 PM, ordered and got our water at 4:40 PM, waited until 5:40 PM with no food, no explanation, and not even single check-in from the waiter. At first, I thought they were just busy, and then I noticed that the two tables who came after us all got their food. After a few back-and-forths with the waiter, we finally got our food. We ordered the Moules Frites, the Braised Short Rib Flatbread, the Point Burger, and the Carbonnade Flamande. My poor 6-year old was starving by then and devoured the Baguette that came with the Moules Frites. Then came the entrees. The flatbread tasted like it was left on the counter overnight. The Brioche bun was over-toasted and became hard and crumbled. The burger patty was cold and dry. The Carbonnade Flamande was...well, at least it had a large portion. The tastiest food tonight was the Moules Frites, but unfortunately, a few mussels were a bit sandy. The waiter was sensible enough to take the flatbread off of our check. I wish I could reverse time and go elsewhere.
(Sorry for being so critical during this particular time because I know many restaurants are short on staff and ingredients. I genuinely hope restaurants like Point Brugge Cafe, much loved by the community, can be where people find enjoyment and normality, not chaos and neglect.)"

Andrew White,10/31/2021,4,1,"Love Point Brugge! If you're s fan of mussels, you'll be pry happy with this place. Service gets high marks, most of the time, but my wife and I have had a couple so-so experiences there. Given the current climate we don't let that detract from the overall opinion. Their moules frites are great, hearty portions.  The steak frites is well done. The poutine has good flavor.... really you don't be disappointed here!"
Rob Taylor,10/31/2021,5,0,"Great food and service, cozy environment and very like some cafe's in London and Belgium or France. Really like being back in Europe. Highly recommend!!"

Ashleah Younker,9/16/2021,5,0,"Their Prix Fixe Brunch was great! Highly recommended. I tried the chicken & biscuits, my partner had the eggs benedict, and our friend had the liege waffle. Everything was great though I think next time I'd pick a different side dish than the hash browns (which seemed like they were fried exactly like my chicken so it was a little too similar for me to eat together)."
Ambika Sharma,9/5/2021,1,0,Had a bad experience with one extremely rude staff member.
Suzie Sunshine,9/4/2021,5,2,"Just tried this place for the first time and it’s lovely! Food is well priced with good portions for your $. Our server Evana was great! She was personable, chill, friendly. I will ask for her again! We had dinner but I heard they also have a brunch so we will be back!! The indoor to outdoor seating style is nice, you go up levels so you can always have a view of outside.

They have pretty good mixed drinks (my fav. Was “The Silverman” which was a twist on a margarita) and a great selection of beers and wine. The menu is clearly Belgian with a lot of dishes with lemon and some very popular mussels (basically everyone but us ordered them). I tried the Chaud Chèvre salad and it was a generous portion with really fresh, healthy greens. You can tell the food is a point of pride because everything looked great, smelled great, and so on. My partner ordered a more traditional beef dish and he LOVED it. Kid friendly too, it’s casual and family oriented.

Overall this place is quaint, on a relatively quiet street next to some other very good restaurants. Street parking was free and easy. I highly recommend! Especially if you like mussels!

Food was very good quality and tasted great. Leasurly pace in the restuarant.  Expect to be here a bit over an hour. But it is an enjoyable place to spend some time.
John Hartog,6/5/2021,5,1,"Was in Pittsburgh for a business trip and this restaurant came recommended. It is a small place but with wonderful food. Having lived in Belgium, I can vouch that the food comes as close as what you would get in Brugge, Belgium. The frites were amazing and the mussels in white wine to die for.

Sophia Calderone,5/16/2021,5,0,"Passed by this place a few times until we finally decided to go for a small bite. Really relaxed environment with art on the walls. You can find the space for you whether it's outdoor seating with drinks in the sun, an intimate catch up in a booth, or casual quiet space in the back. We got the classic mussels and soup of the day which was a chowder. The mussels were fatty and delicious with no fishy aftertaste. The chowder was so good my sister ordered too bowls. It was reminiscent of the feeling of ordering soup as a child in a diner - heartwarming and wholesome. The service was  wonderful and an absolutely sweet server who gave us a lot of bread when we asked for more. Also their beer list is one I am partial too since I lean towards Belgian but I honestly was a fan of their entire beer list ( extremely good job to whoever picked these ). Honestly a wonderful experience and would love to come back the next time I'm in the area."

Was told we only give bead with pasta, he did begrudgingly bring some, we had to flag him down for butter, which was frozen.  I ordered the salmon, it tasted fishy. The other person ordered pasta which was over cooked, and never offered cheese or asked how our dinner was  When you notice that your guests ate very little of their dinner, you might want to ask why.  It was very cold inside and it seemed like they wanted us out. As though we were disturbing them. This is not the Point Brugge that I once knew. And he probably wondered why he only got a 15% tip, and I was over generous considering the service."

The gin and tonic is also a must-try if you are into those - with the addition of diced cucumber, it hits the spot when you need a quick refresh on a warm day."

ikc,10/15/2019,5,3,"We live out of town and we come to Pittsburgh about every two weeks for business. We've tried almost every good restaurant there is in Pittsburgh and by far this is the best for value, quality of food and service. It's not a trendy gimmicky restaurant. It's just a very good place to go and get a great meal. Parking is not as difficult as other places we've visited in the Pittsburgh area. We arrived without reservations and was seated within minutes. The service was outstanding. This is going to be our go to restaurant whenever we are in town. I think other restaurant owners should visit this place and learn how to do it right. Great job.

Chris Smith,10/12/2019,5,0,I went on a date with my fiancé for my birthday. We shared the fried artichoke hearts for an appetizer - what a win! The artichokes were crispy on the outside and yet light on the inside (compared to other fried things like chicken or cheese sticks). The dish came with greens and a gigantic portion of white bean salad flavored with sundried tomato. Really excellent for $10.

The only reason I am giving it 4 of 5 stars is because, as a vegetarian, the options were very expensive but not very creative or unique. I think this place is best suited for a meat/fish eater, as they had many options and unique dishes catering to that diet."

Edwin Yu,6/8/2019,2,2,"Maybe they got so many good ratings that this place’s head got too big. The last time I was here, everything was excellent. We arrived at six and had to wait about 30 minutes. It’s not a bad wait time had the experience, food, and drinks were good. It because quickly clear to me that the problem is inefficient usage of staff. From tables being cleared, to ordering drinks, getting the drinks, ordering food and getting our food... was slow beyond reason. They should either have more wait staff or do the team-waiter method to speed things up to a reasonable pace. Oh, it also took the waiter forever to get our check. Then there’s the food. The mussels were not the freshest. My friend actually encountered two of them that is too far gone. My lamb fettuccine was just not good. The lamb was too dry and stringy and the pasta was over cooked to a point that it fell apart the moment you try to pick it up. Then the waiter didn’t listen and got me a virgin version of the lemonade. I may tide this place one more chance in the future. But today has definitely been a disappointment.

Gregory Shearer,6/1/2019,5,0,I liked it a lot but I also like mussels a lot and these were delicious. The pound and a half is easily apps for four and the duck confit small plate is almost a dinner itself. Point Breeze is a very nice neighborhood to visit as well.
Owner Response,5/30/2019,,,Thanks for the great review!!  It is really nice to hear that we are doing a great job.  The curry sauce is the staff favorite too! Hope to see you again very soon!
Owner Response,5/30/2019,,,Thanks for the great review!!  Good tip on getting here early.
Nikki,5/30/2019,5,1,"You will not find a finer recipe for red curry mussels than this establishment. I was skeptical that I'd enjoy them but it's the best meal I've ever had in my life. I have searched for another place who can make this dish but there is nowhere else that does it like P. Brugge. The building is small but the flavor is huge and price point to me is affordable. The service is always friendly and inviting ... I can't wait to go back.

Robert Seacord,5/26/2019,4,0,"Stopped here on the way back from a funeral.  People in front of us screwed us out of the last table, so we had to sit at the bar.  Food was OK.  Lot's of mussels and stuff on the menu which I guess is what you get when you go to a Belgium restaurant.  Overall not bad."

Laura McAuley,2/19/2019,4,0,"We love this neighborhood place. Good food with a great selection of beer.
Frites with mayonnaise, Belgian style is always good. Our must haves are their Moules (mussels) with red curry sauce served with crusty bread; Chicken Milanese with artichoke hearts, asparagus, tomatoes on a bed of fresh greens; yummy Macaroni Gratin. On this Sunday visit though, their Carbonnade Flamande seemed to lack the depth of flavor it usually had, hence the four stars."

Christiana,8/16/2018,5,0,"This is my go-to restaurant for a special birthday dinner. The mussels in white wine with fries are the classic treat, but the curry-sauced mussels shouldn't be overlooked. Everything I've ever ordered here has been great. I have only 2 criticisms 1. Get a paid Spotify/Pandora account. Ads.. really? 2. Super loud inside. Not where u bring grandpa and grandma."

素晴らしいレビューをありがとう. (Thanks for the great review!)"
mai m,5/27/2018,4,0,"(Translated by Google) Located in a quiet residential area, this restaurant has terrace seats and a bar space. Luckily when I went, I was seated right away before it got too crowded. However, it is a popular restaurant with quite a few people waiting for about an hour. You can eat a wide variety of alcohol and delicious Belgian-Mediterranean cuisine. I didn't try it this time, but the mussels seem to be the restaurant's top recommendation. You can't make a reservation, but it's a great place to visit with friends. The price range is also reasonable and it is one of the restaurants I would like to visit again. I would love to try the brunch next time.

(Original)
閑静な住宅街にあるこのレストランはテラス席、バースペースと２席がありますが、座席数はさほど多くなく、予約も受け付けていないので待っている人で長蛇の列となることもあるようです。私が行った際には幸いにも混雑する前でありすぐに座席に案内されました。しかし、１時間ほどするとかなりの人が待っているくらい人気のレストランです。種類豊富なアルコールと美味しいベルギー・地中海料理が食べられます。今回私はトライしていませんがムール貝がこのレストランの一番のお勧めのようです。予約はできませんが友人と訪れるにも最高の場所です。価格帯も手ごろですし、私はまた行きたいレストランの一つです。次回はブランチもぜひ行ってみたいと思っています。"
Rainee Kaczorowski,5/26/2018,5,0,"Great food and drinks. There are a whole lot of mussels in the large bowl with fries. A bit much for sharing among 3 people as an app, but the curry sauce was delicious. Cobb salad was tasty. Beet risotto seemed a bit mushy, bit still good. Such a cute place."
Pete Rose,5/26/2018,5,0,"Great food, friendly service and a good selection of beer.

yunocky,5/23/2018,5,0,"Nice cafe & bar. This is a very popular restaurant in this area. They offer wide variety of beer and you can have your pick of a lot. Dishes are all tasty, and I especially like daily soup. I ordered Mediterranean plate because it comes at the top of the entree menu and think it is their best recommendation, but it was too much for me to eat up by myself, so you'd better share this plate if you choose it. I hear they don't accept reservation, so you may have to wait for an hour or so to get your table."

Belgian beer) and wine list. Would've gotten 5 stars but our server was just a little flat. Indoor and outdoor seating in a quiet little neighborhood. Next time, we're bringing friends."

It was my first time, and I was really happy! The coffee was really good, and the service staff were all friendly, patient, and had a good sense of humor. I got the waffles and potatoes, and I highly recommend both. 👍👍"

The staff is knowledgeable and our waitress answered all of our questions. I have tried the macaroni, shrimp, and the carbonnade flamande. As a ""pro tip"" I suggest getting any desert and asking for the chocolate sauce they serve with their ice cream...it is to die for! The wait is not very long either, but that depends on what time you go. Though rather expensive, I felt the price was well worth the food!!"

Large selection of Belgian beers. Reservations accepted and recommended for parties of 5 or more at lunch only. Expect a wait at peak lunch and dinner hours. Price is moderate to high. Okay for kids: atmosphere is cheerfully noisy and they have booths where you can trap the kids inside, but remember that wait at peak hours. NOT handicapped accessible. Stairs at the entrance. Small outside dining area for summer months."

They have several different flavors, all of which are delicious. My favorite is the red curry. Of course we add frites and request never ending refills of bread to soak up all the amazing sauce.

My best friend plans business trips to Pittsburgh just so we can go to Point Brugge because it's so good."

Desserts are generally tasty, although some are not that special. In the colder months they've had a pumpkin roll that is perfectly decadent.

It's a pretty small place and can get really busy for dinner, but there's a bar where you can get drinks, and you can also call in orders to go. Lunch is less busy. During the warmer months they open outdoor seating.

I've only been disappointed twice here, once by a fish special (it just didn't taste like much) and by the brunch (small portions and underwhelming flavor, including a very sad waffle). Sticking to the lunch or dinner menu has never let me down.

They have daily specials which usually hits the spot (I'm dreaming of that duck breast now). Their mussles are a must get and I recommend the Thai spiced ones."

Robin Pike (Robin C Pike),4/3/2017,5,0,Hidden gem in the Point Breeze neighborhood--one of my favorite places for brunch or lunch (also good dinners)! Small restaurant so the wait time can be longer during peak times. Limited outdoor seating. Really tasty food at competitive prices for the quality. Super friendly staff!!!

John Hall,3/13/2017,5,0,"My personal ""must go-to"" dinner restaurant for Pittsburgh. Cozy, no reservations, and normally pretty busy but they're pretty good at estimating an accurate wait time. My favorites are the mussels fromage (the sauce is garlic, shallots, bacon, spinach, bleu cheese, and beer) with frites for my main and the antipasto plate with cheese for starter."

The flavor of the mussels we got was formage which is a little strong if you have a sensitive palate but it was very good."

Jon Forrester,8/15/2016,3,0,"We went here yesterday for our 7th anniversary, my wife had visited the sister restaurant with her parents and loved it so she had high expectations. The biggest thing against the place was there were flies swarming everywhere throughout our meal. The staff were friendly, and the cheese tray was great.However neither one of us were impressed with our entrees and for the price it was a real disappointment."
Ryan Bell,8/15/2016,4,1,A great neighborhood restaurant. Food is always delicious and service is friendly. Although Sunday brunch can be rather busy (a line starts ~15 minutes before they open) I highly recommend it!

This is a great place to bring visitors to Pittsburgh whether it be for business or pleasure.  Wait times can be long, so plan accordingly... but it's worth it."

Salmon is excellent. The swordfish special was out of this world!"

Hendrik Schneider,5/31/2015,5,0,Great food. The only place I have ever had comparable Moules frites was a restaurant in Paris. Nice atmosphere. Friendly staff. Nothing more to say.
cindy coffen,2/28/2015,5,0,Just had dinner the muscles with bacon & cream sauce was to die for. Small bite crab cakes were great. Enjoyed my night out.
Steve DC,2/5/2015,1,1,"Beware of what you order here.  The menu does a poor job of describing the item.  I ordered a ""braised lamb shoulder"" that turned out to be somewhat of a thick marinara sauce with a bit of shredded lamb on polenta."
Derek Ferguson,1/26/2015,2,1,"Fries are awesome, but that's about it. Sandwiches are very average. Staff is different. I don't like seafood so if I did I would probably rate higher for the mussels. But I've just always had the sandwiches. And fries. I love the fries."
Brian Lukacs,12/28/2014,5,0,
Robert Smith,12/13/2014,5,0,"My family had lunch here today.  We thoroughly enjoyed it.  Really liked the stained glass artwork in the windows - pleasing decor and comfortable seating.  The gnocchi with butternut squash was very good.  We each had a variety of veggies that were fresh and tasty.  My daughter really liked her chicken and sausage gumbo.  The pumpkin dessert with the cheese filling was excellent.  The restaurant is fairly small, so we had to wait 20 minutes for a table - but it was worth the wait.  The building isn't handicap accessible.  We thought we'd be able to order Belgian waffles from the picture on the web site, but they only have those for Sunday brunch.  Most of the lunch options are in the $10 to $15 range."
Judas Bull,9/13/2014,5,0,"What to say?  This place is great, definitely one of our favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh.  The Mussels, seared Salmon, the bread, the chocolate cake, the fancy fries, everything is expertly prepared and freaking delicious.  Atmosphere is great, tons of amazing beers, and the service is always friendly.  You must check it out, and don't worry about the wait, just have a couple tasty brews at the bar."
Jun,3/22/2014,5,0,The best mussels I had ever with awesome beer!  My friend told me we would need to go there as early as 5:30 to get available table.

We'll definitely go back later this year. Try it. Good food at a decent price."
Bruce Gilleylen,6/11/2013,5,0,
Jennifer Smith,5/1/2013,5,0,"I took my mother to the Point Brugge Cafe a few years ago and still rave about the experience. We both ordered very different food (mussels, salmon, and a meat dish), and everything was equally amazing. The finesse is in the details--the sauces and the seasoning.

I wish the restaurant accepted reservations, but because it is so busy and small, I understand why they do not. This also causes the interior to become overpacked and busy, but seating is better in the summer when you can both wait and dine outside.

My favorite meal so far in Pittsburgh hands down."

Katy Knight,12/5/2012,4,0,Worth the 40 minute wait! Our server was super friendly and the beer selection was great. The mussels and frites are insanely good (and apparently so is the wild boar special that one of my coworkers had). The cheese plate starter is a diverse mix of cheeses and accompaniments that our group of 4 really enjoyed.

Robbie Sedgewick,6/7/2012,5,0,One of our favorite restaurants right now.  Great mussels and beer.  Only problem is that it is difficult to convince my parents to go anywhere else!

Barbara Fang,11/10/2011,4,0,"I am a mussel fanatic. I dream about mussels. I considered getting mussels tattooed onto my biceps (GET IT?). How could I not try Point Brugge Cafe? I went all of two times, and I can't say I had a bad experience either time, but I also can't say it was exceptional. Sure, the beer is good, but the Sharp Edge has a more extensive collection of Belgian beers. The food is good - mussels, of course - but I had more memorable mussels at Casbah. The mussel broth is luscious, and they are served with the classic pomme frites with mayonnaise (don't knock it 'til you rock it, and you must rock it). However, the mussels I had were a bit overcooked, which may have just been bad luck. Do not attempt to order both the mussels and an entree with the hopes of finishing them unless you're that guy from Man vs. Food. The mac and cheese was a bit dry and...flavorless. But it's still a nice place to have dinner if you have good company and some time to wait for a table since the place is quite cramped, which ups the coziness factor."
